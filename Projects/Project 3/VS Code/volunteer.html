                    <p>Volunteers are an integral part of the healing process employed by
                    HHH. They forge new connections with children from broken families
                    and help them learn to trust again. They also encourage them to
                    extend this trust to the world.</p>
                    <br />    
                    <p>You can be a part of this process by joining our Volunteer team!</p>
